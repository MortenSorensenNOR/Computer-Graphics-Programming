I need a graphics library to show the result of the rasterization.
The library is preferably very barebones. All I really need is a framebuffer, and a way to 
show its contets on the screen. 

OpenGL is an obvious choice, but I feel it might be a bit too feature rich for what I'm trying to do.
It seems writing directly to the linux framebuffer might be an option. 

Direct to linux framebuffer is a bad idea. It means I have to use the emulator only in a virtual console,
and it seems to be a bit bugged anyways.

Using the X11 graphics library seems to be the best choice. It is well supported, and writing directly to the framebuffer
is a possibility. Alaso, it means I can work directly in I3, which is a big bonus.
