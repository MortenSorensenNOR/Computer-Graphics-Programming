I need a graphics library to show the result of the rasterization.
The library is preferably very barebones. All I really need is a framebuffer, and a way to 
show its contets on the screen. 

OpenGL is an obvious choice, but I feel it might be a bit too feature rich for what I'm trying to do.
It seems writing directly to the linux framebuffer might be an option.
